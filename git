what is different between svn and git?
ans:- The basic difference between git and svn is
git is an distribtuted control system
svn is an centralised control system
let's take the scenario if two developers are working on the caluculator operations and one developer is working on addition one is an substration and they both send their code to centralised control
system called svn from there both developers can communicate and if incase the centralised control system got crashed then there is no communication between to developers and also data has not
been saved anywhere 

the same scenario in git the same two developers are on the calulator operation and both developers send their code to distrubuted control system called github and they are forking it and they saved
it and they are communicate each other if incase the control system got crashed but no problem they already have the another copy of the file

git command and their uses:-

life cycle of git:
git init : it will intialize the empty git repository
git add : it will move our local files to staging area
git commit : it will use to commits the files 
git diff : it is used to difference between previous and present version
git status : it is used to see the status of the working directory
git log : it is used to see the commits and logs of the files
git reset --hard commit id of the version : it is used to jump into the specific version
