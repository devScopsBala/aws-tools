what is autoscaling?
Ans:- Autoscaling is a cloud computing and infrastructure management technique that can be used in aws to add the instances
according to the cpu utilization. and autoscaling are of two types and they are:
1.Horizontal scaling:-
in horizontal scaling the instaces will automatically created while load is increased and in horizontal scaling we have two types scale-in and scale -out
scale-in:- if u want add the instances it is known as scale-in
scale-out:- it is used to remove the instances it is known as scale-out
2.vertical scaling:-
In vertical scaling we can do that in manual process that when the instances load is over then we will remove the instance and keep another server
instead of that with high cpu and memory and here we have some downtime so that we can loose the bussiness
